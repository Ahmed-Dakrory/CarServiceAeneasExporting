</p>

<br></br><br></br>

</p>
<br></br><br></br>



<p style="text-align: justify;" class="mainHead">

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="secondHead">
c. Storage Location. Company will store the Goods at its discretion at any one or more buildings

In the event of the foregoing breach of Customer warranties, Customer shall be liable for all
expenses costs, losses, damages, fines, penalties or other expenses of any sort incurred by
Company in connection with the removal, or destruction, or handling of the Goods and shall

with the Goods.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="secondHead">
e. For all Goods tendered for storage, Customer shall supply such information and documents
as are necessary to comply with all laws, rules and regulations. For all Goods, Customer shall

</p>
<br></br><br></br>



<p style="text-align: justify;" class="mainHead">
9. Liability.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="secondHead">
a. Company shall not be liable for any loss or destruction of or damage to the Goods, however
caused, unless such loss, damage or destruction resulted from Company’s failure to exercise
such care in regard to the Goods as a reasonably careful person would exercise under like
circumstances. Company is not liable for damages which could not have been avoided by the
exercise of such care. Company and Customer agree that Company’s duty of care referred to
herein shall not extend to providing a sprinkler system at the warehouse complex or any portion
thereof.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="secondHead">
b. In no event shall Company be liable for any loss or damage caused by:
</p>
<br></br>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="thirdHead">
1. acts of God; public authorities acting with actual or apparent authority; strikes; labor disputes;
weather; mechanical or equipment failures; cyber attacks; civil commotions; hazards incident to
a state of war; acts of terrorism; acts or omissions of customs or quarantine officials; acts of
carriers related to security; the nature of the freight or any defects thereof; inherent vice of the
goods; perishable qualities of the merchandise; fires; frost or change of weather; sprinkler
leakage; floods; wind; storm; moths; public enemies; or other causes beyond its control;
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="thirdHead">
2. fragile articles injured or broken, unless packed by Company’s employees and unpacked by
them at the time of delivery;
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="thirdHead">
3. pilferage or theft, unless such loss or damage is caused by the failure of Company to
exercise such ordinary care required by law; and
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="thirdHead">
4. concealed damage, or for losses incurred due to the concealed damage of the Goods.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="thirdHead">
5. Any damage or loss to personal property stored by the Shipper inside a Vehicle or other
contents of Vehicles.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="thirdHead">
6. Any damage or loss to Cargo caused by rust, mold, mildew or vermin.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="thirdHead">
7. Any damage to the undercarriage or the interior of any Vehicle.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" class="thirdHead">
8. Any damage or loss resulting from the act, default or omission of the Shipper, Consignee or
any other party claiming an interest in the shipment including, but not limited to, incorrect
declaration of Cargo, improper or insufficient packing, securing, marking or addressing of your
shipment, or resulting from the acts or omissions of the recipient.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" class="thirdHead">
9. Any damage or loss resulting from the failure of the Shipper or Consignee to observe any of
the provisions set forth in these Terms.
</p>

<br></br>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="secondHead">
c. Monetary Maximum Liability: In the event of loss or damage to the Goods for which Company
is legally liable, Company’s liability shall be limited to actual value of the Goods, subject to a
maximum of USD $.50 per pound of goods stored, unless Customer declared a higher value for
the goods and Company agrees in writing to purchase insurance for the Goods at Customer’s
benefit, and Customer has paid the supplementary charge in accordance with the terms herein.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="secondHead">
d. In no event shall Company be responsible for loss or damage to documents, stamps,
securities, artwork, heirlooms, jewelry or other articles of high and unusual value unless a
special agreement in writing is made between Company and Customer with respect to such
articles.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" class="secondHead">
e. No Consequential Damages. IN NO EVENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF BREACH OF
COMPANY’S DUTIES, NEGLIGENCE LIABILITY WITHOUT FAULT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
THEORY OR BASIS, SHALL COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, STATUTORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF MARKET, LOSS OF INCOME, DAMAGES ARISING
FROM LOSS, ATTORNEYS FEES OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WRONG DELIVERY, OR
DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, LOSS OF USE OF GOODS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS,

COMPANY HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES MIGHT OCCUR.
</p>
<br></br><br></br>


<p style="text-align: justify;" class="mainHead">
10. Optional Insurance Offering. Company does not insure the Goods while in storage and the
storage rates or charges billed to Customer do not include any insurance on the Goods. The
Goods will therefore not be insured for any loss or damage, and the limitation of Liability set
forth in paragraph 9 shall apply in all circumstances where Company is legally liable for such
loss or damage, unless the Customer has requested in writing that Company obtain insurance
for the Customer’s benefit, and the Customer has paid the required premium to Company for
such additional insurance. Except as provided above, Company will not obtain insurance on the
Goods for Customer’s benefit while the Goods are being stored at Company’s facility.
</p>

<br></br><br></br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"  class="mainHead">
11. Temperature or Humidity Controlled Storage. Unless specifically agreed to in writing,
Company shall not be responsible for storage of the Goods in a temperature or humidity
controlled environment. Customer knowingly accepts that the Goods will be warehoused in a
non-temperature/humidity controlled environment. Company will not be responsible for any loss
or damage to the Goods that result from fluctuations in temperature range or in humidity levels
of the warehouse. Company will furthermore not be responsible for losses or damages incurred
to Perishable Goods, unless otherwise agreed to in writing prior to tender of the Goods for
storage.
</p>

<br></br><br></br>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="mainHead">
12. Inspection &amp; Security. All shipments are subject to inspection by Company; by Company’s
Carriers for any transportation services provided, if any; and by any duly authorized government
or regulatory entities, including but not limited to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration,
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and like entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing right to
inspect shipments, the Company is not obligated to perform such inspection except as
mandated by law. Further, the Company reserves the right to unilaterally reject any shipment
that it deems unfit for transport, or for storage under this Warehouse Receipt, after inspection.
</p>
<br></br><br></br>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="mainHead">
13. Notice of Claim and Filing of Suit.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" class="secondHead">

the Goods unless it is timely filed, in writing, within a maximum of sixty (60) days after Customer
knew, or should have known by the exercise of reasonable care, of such loss or damage.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="secondHead">
b. Time Bar. Any lawsuit or other claim against Company with respect to the Goods shall be
forever waived unless commenced within one ( 1 year ) after Customer knew, or should have

understanding between Customer and Company regarding the storage of the Goods and
services provided. This Warehouse Receipt supersedes all prior or contemporaneous verbal or
written negotiations, statements, representations, or agreements. This Warehouse Receipt may
not be modified except for a written agreement between Customer and an officer of Company. If
any section or portion of this Warehouse Receipt is held by any court to be illegal or
unenforceable it shall not affect the legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions or terms
and conditions herein. Company’s failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of
this Warehouse Receipt shall not constitute a waiver or estoppel to later demand strict
compliance thereof and shall not constitute a waiver of or estoppel to insist upon strict
compliance with all other provisions of this Warehouse Receipt.
</p>

<br></br><br></br>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="mainHead">
